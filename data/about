About Ouiche
---
<p>
  Ouiche is a wiki-like system that helps you publishing pages about whatever
  you want.\\
  It was originally designed to publish wishlists.
</p>

<p>
  Ouiche is written in [Ruby #ruby] with the lightweight [Sinatra #sinatra]
  web framework. The source is available [on Github #source].
</p>

<p>
  Pages are stored in a HTML/Textile mixture format which provides many
  shortcuts to avoid typing inline tags. Ouiche auto-discovers files that are
  in it's data folder and generates an index page for you.\\
  If you don't want a page to show up in the index, just prepend a colon (:) to
  it's filename.\\
  Look at the default about page to learn more about what you can do.
<p>

<p>
  Ouiche is _completely_ Open-Source (published under the WTFPL): you can do
  whatever you want with the source code, and I'll happily accept any patches or
  improvements (use GitHub for that!)
</p>

<p>
  Install is simple, just copy the files and create or modify the `config.ru`
  file:
</p>

{{{
  require ::File.join(::File.dirname(__FILE__), 'ouiche')
  run Ouiche::App
}}}

<p>
  Then `rackup` it to launch the web server.
