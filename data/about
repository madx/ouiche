About Ouiche
---
Ouiche is a lightweight personal wiki engine that uses flat text files.

Ouiche is written in [Ruby][1] with the [Sinatra][2] web framework. The data
files are written in Markdown, so you need to have [RDiscount][3].

It is completely Open-Source (published under the WTFPL): you can do whatever
you want with the source code, and I'll happily accept any patches or
improvements (use GitHub for that!). If we meet, you can also buy me a beer :)

## Usage #######################################################################

Lists are stored in the `data/` folder.

The file format is easy:

    Title
    ---
    Some text in Markdown.

The title will be used as the page title (awesome!), the part after the `---`'s
will be the body of the page. Period.

If you want a page to be skipped in the index page, just prepend the filename
with a `+`.
