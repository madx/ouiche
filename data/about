About Ouiche
---
* Ouiche is a system that helps you publishing lists.\\
  You can use it to share your wishlists, store bookmarks, manage your
  todolists, etc.
* Ouiche is written in [Ruby #ruby] with the lightweight [Sinatra #sinatra]
  web framework. The source is available [on Github #source].
* Lists are stored in plain text files and are written in a compact and easy to
  learn format. Ouiche auto-discovers lists that are in it's data folder and
  generates an index page for you if you have multiple lists.
* Generated HTML is clean, and the stylesheet is very short, so you can easily
  customize Ouiche to fit your design needs.
* Last but not least, Ouiche is _completely_ Open-Source (published under the
  WTFPL): you can do whatever you want with the source code, and I'll
  happily accept any patches or improvements (use GitHub for that!)
* Install is simple, just copy the files and create or modify the `config.ru`
  file:
  {{{
    require ::File.join(::File.dirname(__FILE__), 'ouiche')
    Ouiche.load!
    run Ouiche::App
  }}}
